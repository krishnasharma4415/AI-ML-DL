Cancer,40176202,Alternative regimen for chemotherapy-intolerant lymphoma including practical aspects in Japan.,"Ohmoto A, Fuji S",2025,"INTRODUCTION: With the increasing number of elderly patients with lymphoma and the emergence of novel agents, clinical investigations for patients considered intolerant to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy are receiving more focus than before.
AREAS COVERED: This review aims to provide an overview of systemic treatment for patients with lymphoma who are intolerant to conventional chemotherapy, including practical aspects in Japan.
EXPERT OPINION: Traditional approaches include dose reduction (e.g. mini-CHOP) or non-anthracycline regimens (e.g. CVP or bendamustine-based regimens) to reduce the risk of cardiotoxicity. A recent trend is the combination of molecular-targeted agents, such as lenalidomide plus rituximab in B-cell lymphoma. However, maintaining durable responses remains a major challenge. In the future, clinical trials in elderly or frail patients are expected to investigate novel agents such as antibody-drug conjugates or bispecific T-cell engagers. In addition, comprehensive geriatric assessment for tailored therapeutic intervention or dose optimization strategies based on individual genomic data is expected in the context of prospective studies.",94,1178,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176202/
Cancer,40176194,Feasibility of an exercise program in endocrine-treated metastatic breast cancer patients with overweight: protocol for the FEMA study.,"Wissing M, Skovlund P, Drysdale S, Amidi A, Zachariae R, Laurberg T, Borgquist S",2025,"BACKGROUND: Many patients with metastatic breast cancer can live relatively long lives but are challenged by treatment- and cancer-related side effects such as weight gain, physical deconditioning, and reduced quality of life, possibly affecting survival. In particular, endocrine treatments are associated with an increased risk of weight gain and adverse metabolic effects. There is a need for interventions to prevent side effects among patients with disseminated breast cancer. Exercise is found to be effective in improving quality of life, metabolic health, and body composition in the curative setting, yet evidence in the metastatic setting is sparse. The aim of this study is to assess feasibility of a 12-week exercise intervention for metastatic breast cancer patients with overweight receiving endocrine therapy and to explore potential effects on metabolic health, body composition, physical performance, obesity-related biomarkers, and patient-reported outcomes.
METHODS: The FEMA study is a randomized controlled feasibility trial in which 21 endocrine-treated patients with metastatic breast cancer and overweight will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either a 12-week training program with three weekly training sessions (intervention), or usual care (control), which includes standard clinical follow-up and supportive care without structured exercise. Feasibility will be assessed based on recruitment rate, adherence, retention, and acceptability, employing both quantitative and qualitative approaches for data collection. Participants' experiences will be explored by interviews and analyzed based on content analysis. Data are collected from blood samples, bioelectrical impedance analysis, physical performance tests, blood pressure measurements, and validated questionnaires on health-related quality of life, self-efficacy for coping with cancer, and sleep quality for explorative analyses.
DISCUSSION: The planned study will allow us to determine whether this 12-week exercise intervention is feasible in endocrine-treated metastatic breast cancer patients with overweight and explore potential effects on metabolic health, body composition, physical performance, obesity-related biomarkers, and patient-reported outcomes. Information from feasibility outcomes will inform the design of a future definitive randomized controlled trial.

Cancer,40176185,Deep learning-based reconstruction and superresolution for MR-guided thermal ablation of malignant liver lesions.,"Winkelmann MT, Kübler J, Gassenmaier S, Nickel DM, Ashkar A, Nikolaou K, Afat S, Hoffmann R",2025,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the impact of deep learning-enhanced T1-weighted VIBE sequences (DL-VIBE) on image quality and procedural parameters during MR-guided thermoablation of liver malignancies, compared to standard VIBE (SD-VIBE).
METHODS: Between September 2021 and February 2023, 34 patients (mean age: 65.4 years; 13 women) underwent MR-guided microwave ablation on a 1.5 T scanner. Intraprocedural SD-VIBE sequences were retrospectively processed with a deep learning algorithm (DL-VIBE) to reduce noise and enhance sharpness. Two interventional radiologists independently assessed image quality, noise, artifacts, sharpness, diagnostic confidence, and procedural parameters using a 5-point Likert scale. Interrater agreement was analyzed, and noise maps were created to assess signal-to-noise ratio improvements.
RESULTS: DL-VIBE significantly improved image quality, reduced artifacts and noise, and enhanced sharpness of liver contours and portal vein branches compared to SD-VIBE (p < 0.01). Procedural metrics, including needle tip detectability, confidence in needle positioning, and ablation zone assessment, were significantly better with DL-VIBE (p < 0.01). Interrater agreement was high (Cohen κ = 0.86). Reconstruction times for DL-VIBE were 3 s for k-space reconstruction and 1 s for superresolution processing. Simulated acquisition modifications reduced breath-hold duration by approximately 2 s.
CONCLUSION: DL-VIBE enhances image quality during MR-guided thermal ablation while improving efficiency through reduced processing and acquisition times.",113,1578,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176185/

Homogeneous participation in clinical studies contributes to health disparities, particularly among historically underrepresented groups in the United States (US). Racial, ethnic, and other minoritized populations have long been excluded from clinical research. In response, the US Congress mandated the National Institutes of Health to assess the impacts of insufficient diversity in clinical studies. Despite efforts by the government, non-profit organizations, and industry players to improve diversity in clinical studies, progress has been slow due to fragmented approaches. For instance, the new US administration (2025) has recently released executive orders which threaten to reverse the progress made in inclusive clinical research. The Stanford Think Tank on Diversity and Equity in Clinical Trials, held in September 2023, brought together key partners across multiple sectors and professions to discuss barriers and explore potential solutions to participation in clinical studies. In this commentary, we discuss the importance of collaborative, inclusive strategies in clinical study design to advance equitable health outcomes for all. Further, we discuss potential implications of the government's dismissal of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives on diverse research participation.",144,1470,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176184/
Cancer,40176183,The association between fruit and vegetable intake and the odds of asthma among children and adolescents.,"Rostampour K, Sasanfar B, Reshadfar A, Emarati A, Nafei Z, Behniafard N, Hashemi-Bajgani SM, Salehi-Abargouei A",2025,"BACKGROUND: Previous epidemiological studies on the correlation between fruit and vegetable consumption and asthma, the majority of them were conducted in developed countries, have led to conflicting results. This study aimed to examine the relationship between fruit and vegetable intake and the risk of asthma among a large sample of children and adolescents.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted as part of the Global Asthma Network (GAN) on 7667 Iranian children and adolescents. Asthma and its related outcomes were measured using validated questionnaires. A food frequency method was used to assess the dietary intake. The association between fruit and vegetable intake and asthma and its related symptoms was examined using logistic regression.
RESULTS: After adjustment for all possible confounding variables, no significant association was found between fruit and vegetable intake and the odds of medication use for asthma and asthma confirmed by a doctor. However, an inverse significant trend was found between fruits intake and current asthma. After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and the use of television and computers, participants who regularly consumed fruit had a 37% lower likelihood of experiencing wheezing in the past 12 months (OR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.42-0.94, P trend = 0.001) compared to those who never or only occasionally consumed fruit. Additionally, individuals who reported consuming vegetables most or all days had a 38% reduced chance of wheezing in the past 12 months (OR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.48-0.80, P trend < 0.001) compared to participants with infrequent vegetable intake. Participants with regular fruit and vegetable intake combined (OR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.31-0.82, P trend < 0.001) had a 50% lower likelihood of wheezing in the past 12 months in comparison with those who never or only occasionally fruits and vegetables combined consumers.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that regular consumption of fruits and vegetables on most or all days has a protective effect against wheezing in the past 12 months. Future longitudinal studies should be conducted to confirm our findings.",105,2125,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176183/
Cancer,40176181,Modified screening of MYC promotor region elements using the CRISPR library in ovarian cancer.,"Yamamoto A, Tanaka Y, Ishibashi S, Ikeda M, Sugita K, Ono M, Nishi H, Kurata M",2025,"Ovarian cancer remains one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies owing to its high recurrence rate and chemotherapeutic resistance. MYC is a well-known proto-oncogene that is frequently amplified in ovarian cancer and has been implicated in drug resistance. Previously, we established a new promoter-reporter system combined with a CRISPR activation library to identify unknown MYC regulators, and M1AP was identified as a novel MYC regulator. However, considering the insufficient explanation for the absence of guide RNA (gRNA) of MYC, this present study explored methods to prevent the gRNA of MYC itself from binding. This study first modified the promoter-reporter vector to improve its quality, then conducted CRISPR screening and analyzed candidate genes as MYC promoter regulators using next-generation sequencing in OVSAHO ovarian cancer cells. Eighty-six genes had ≥ 1000 reads, and Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis was performed on the cBioPortal of the Cancer Genomics database. Fourteen genes were identified as candidate MYC regulators with positive and significant correlations with MYC. Seven genes, including CYP4v2, ASPH, ANP32D, PCED1A, ABI1, FUZ, and HOOK2, demonstrated significantly higher luciferase activity than the control genes. Four genes, including ABI1, PCED1A, HOOK2, and CYP4v2, activated the MYC promoter, which showed over twofold higher activity than the control when overexpressed using a vector. In conclusion, four genes that activate MYC promoters were identified in an ovarian cancer cell line using the CRISPR library system with a modified promoter-reporter tool. These results will prove helpful in the development of novel treatment strategies for ovarian cancer.",94,1725,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176181/

The phenotypic variance explained by identified genetic variants remains limited, highlighting the importance of searching for additional factors beyond genetic sequence variants. DNA methylation has been linked to lipid concentrations in previous studies, although most of the studies harbored moderate sample sizes and exhibited underrepresentation of non-European ancestry populations. In addition, knowledge of nongenetic factors on lipid profiles is extremely limited. In the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Study, we performed methylome-wide association analysis on 9,561 participants from diverse race and ethnicity backgrounds for HDL-c, LDL-c, TC, and TG levels, and also tested interactions between smoking or alcohol intake and methylation in their association with lipid levels. We identified novel CpG sites at 16 loci (P < 1.18E-7) with successful replication on 3,215 participants. One additional novel locus was identified in the self-reported White participants (P = 4.66E-8). Although no additional CpG sites were identified in the genome-wide interaction analysis, 13 reported CpG sites showed significant heterogeneous association across smoking or alcohol intake strata. By mapping novel and reported CpG sites to genes, we identified enriched pathways directly linked to lipid metabolism as well as ones spanning various biological functions. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of lipid concentrations.",133,1566,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176173/
Cancer,40176156,IL13RA2-integrated genetically engineered mouse model allows for CAR T cells targeting pediatric high-grade gliomas.,"Seblani M, Zannikou M, Duffy JT, Joshi T, Levine RN, Thakur A, Puigdelloses-Vallcorba M, Horbinski CM, Miska J, Hambardzumyan D, Becher OJ, Balyasnikova IV",2025,"Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG) and pediatric diffuse midline gliomas (pDMG) are devastating diseases without durable and curative options. Although targeted immunotherapy has shown promise, the field lacks immunocompetent animal models to study these processes in detail. To achieve this, we developed a fully immunocompetent, genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) for pDMG and pHGG that incorporates the glioma-associated antigen, interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13RA2). Utilizing the RCAS-Tva delivery system in Nestin-Tva mice, we induced gliomagenesis by overexpressing PDGFB and deleting p53 (p53fl/fl) or both p53 and PTEN (p53fl/fl PTENfl/fl), with or without IL13RA2 in neonatal mice. De novo tumors developed in models with and without IL13RA2, showing no statistical difference in onset (n = 33, 38 days, p = 0.62). The p53fl/fl PTENfl/fl tumors displayed more aggressive characteristics (n = 12, 31 days). Tumors exhibited features typical of high-grade glioma, including infiltration, pseudopalisading necrosis, and microvascular proliferation. They also showed a high Ki-67 index, variable IL13RA2 expression, a high frequency of CD11b + macrophages, and a low proportion of CD3 + T cells. The model proved effective for evaluating IL13RA2-targeted immunotherapies, with a significant response to CAR T-cell treatment that extended survival (46 days vs. 28 days control; p &lt; 0.0001) and achieved 25% long-term survival in mice. This model facilitates the preclinical assessment of IL13RA2-directed therapies and holds potential for clinical application.",116,1581,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176156/
Cancer,40176155,The Chinese version of the autonomy preference index for advanced cancer patients: a study on cultural adaptation based on cognitive interview.,"Yan C, Li Y, Ai J, Yang S",2025,"BACKGROUND: The global cancer burden is becoming increasingly severe. In the context of patient-centred medicine, respecting patients' autonomy and preferences is of paramount importance. However, there is currently a lack of scientific tools in China to measure the autonomous preferences of advanced cancer patients. We aim to optimise assessment tools for patients' autonomous preferences and validate their effectiveness, thereby filling a gap in related research, in hopes of improving the quality of medical care in China.
OBJECTIVES: ① To assess the semantic clarity of entries of the Chinese Autonomy Preference Index (API) and determine whether patients can accurately comprehend their content. ② To validate the application effect of cognitive interviews in the translation of the scale into the Chinese culture and context.
METHODS: In March and April 2023, we selected 17 advanced cancer patients by convenience sampling in Zunyi, Guizhou, China, to participate in this study. We assessed their understanding of each item in the Chinese API scale through cognitive interviews and made the corresponding revisions to the scale items based on the interview results.
RESULTS: The respondents' understanding of various API entries after translation and adaptation was assessed. Based on the interview results, ambiguous entries were revised to create a refined Chinese version of the API. Ultimately, the API comprises two dimensions and 23 entries. The results of the first round of interviews revealed doubts or ambiguities in the semantic expression and understanding of 5 items, which were then revised following discussions by the research team. The second round of interviews confirmed that the interviewees could correctly understand the content of the entries without further modifications.
CONCLUSIONS: ① Cognitive interviews can address discrepancies in the understanding of scale items among the target population and mitigate measurement errors stemming from item content ambiguity. ② Targeted questionnaire revisions have improved the accuracy, reliability, and applicability of the Chinese version of the API questionnaire. The Chinese version of the Autonomy-Preference-Index offers clinical healthcare professionals an effective measurement tool to assess the autonomous preferences of advanced cancer patients.",143,2335,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176155/
Cancer,40176150,Association between periodontitis and gastrointestinal cancer risk and prognosis: evidence from a nested case-control study in Southwest China.,"Luo T, Li J, Pu K, Yang G",2025,"BACKGROUND: With low early detection rates and high incidence and mortality, Gastrointestinal cancer (GIC) imposes a significant global health burden. Emerging evidence indicates that periodontitis may be a potential risk factor for GIC development; however, epidemiological data remains inconclusive.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the impact of periodontitis on the incidence, recurrence, and metastasis of GIC in Southwest China, thereby offering epidemiological evidence to support GIC prevention and management.
METHODS: Between September 2022 and August 2024, a case-control study was conducted at the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College. Five hundred GIC patients were included as the case group based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, while 1005 healthy individuals were recruited for the control group. Multivariate analyses were performed to examine the associations between periodontitis and GIC incidence, recurrence, and metastasis while controlling for potential confounding factors.
RESULTS: The results of this study demonstrated that periodontitis was significantly associated with the incidence of esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancer. Even after adjusting for potential confounders, it remained a significant risk factor for esophageal cancer (OR = 2.810, 95% CI 1.032-7.649, P = 0.043), colon cancer (OR = 2.330, 95% CI 1.072-5.067, P = 0.033), and rectal cancer (OR = 2.730, 95% CI 1.247-5.379, P = 0.012). Compared to non-periodontitis subjects, periodontitis showed a significant association with distant metastasis of rectal cancer (aHR = 5.332, 95% CI 1.406-20.220, P = 0.014). Moreover, severe periodontitis was identified as an risk factor for distant metastasis in rectal cancer (aHR = 10.138, 95% CI 1.824-56.354, P = 0.008).
CONCLUSION: This study highlights significant associations between periodontitis and an increased risk of esophageal and colorectal cancers. Additionally, patients with rectal cancer and periodontitis exhibited an increased risk of distant metastasis compared to those without periodontitis.",143,2095,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176150/

",2025,"BACKGROUND: Single-sampling strategy (SSS) for blood cultures (BC) has not been evaluated in infective endocarditis (IE). We assessed the diagnostic performance of SSS vs conventional multi-sampling strategy (MSS) in IE diagnosis.
METHODS: Patients suspected of IE were prospectively enrolled in 8 tertiary-care centers. Five BC bottle pairs were sampled from each patient. Pairs 1, 2 and 3 were sampled simultaneously, followed by 2 additional separate pairs (4 and 5) sampled more than one hour later. Pairs 1, 2, and 3 emulated SSS and pairs 1, 4, and 5 emulated MSS. The sensitivity and specificity of the major microbiologic criterion of the 2015-ESC IE diagnostic criteria, based on the SSS and MSS BC results, were calculated using the endocarditis team's diagnosis as the gold standard.
RESULTS: An IE was diagnosed in 101 (39.4%) of the 256 patients enrolled. Sensitivity rates of SSS and MSS were 50.5% (95%CI [40.7-60.2]) and 45.5% (95%CI [35.8-55.3]), respectively (p = 0.063), while specificity rates were 94.8% (95%CI [91.4-98.3]) and 95.5% (95%CI [92.2-98.8]), respectively (p = 1). In IE patients, SSS as compared to MSS accurately upgraded the diagnosis from possible to definite IE in one patient and downgraded it in none.
CONCLUSION: Using SSS to define the major microbiologic criterion was as sensitive and specific as using MSS for diagnosing IE. Using SSS instead of MSS BC results did not lead to erroneous changes in diagnostic class according to the 2015 ESC criteria. Consequently, SSS may be regarded as standard practice for IE diagnosis.",147,1568,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176205/

Aim of this single-center retrospective study was to evaluate strategies for minimizing periprocedural access complications as part of an interdisciplinary structural heart program.
METHODS: Included were all patients who underwent TAVI between 09/2022 and 08/2023 at our institution. All procedures were performed by a heart team, consisting of a cardiovascular surgeon with peripheral vascular and interventional experience and an interventional cardiologist on site. Valvular type and size, access route and backup strategies were assessed by the heart team according to the preoperative CT-imaging. Baseline characteristics, periprocedural data, complications and 30-day outcomes were analyzed concerning the access route using Mann-Whitney-U-test or Fisher´s exact test.
RESULTS: Analyzed were 167 consecutive patients (81 (76-85) years; 53.3% male). 48 (28.7%) of these had severe peripheral artery disease. 130 (77.8%) procedures were performed via a percutaneous transfemoral approach, 13 (7.8%) via a femoral cut-down and 4 (2.4%) via a transaxillary access. For 20 procedures (11.9%) a transapical access was used. 106 patients (72%) with transvascular and all patients with transapical access received a balloon-expanding valve, whereas 41 (28%) patients with transvascular access received a self-expanding prosthesis. No coronary occlusion was seen. Annular rupture occurred in one patient (0.6%), valve displacement in two patients (1.2%). Totally 5 (3%) access femoral arteries were stented and 8 (4.8%) needed a surgical reconstruction. 30-day mortality was 2.99%.

Some recent epidemiological studies suggest to consider other complications. As such, cardiovascular (CV) issues have been the subject of few studies to date. The aim of this review is to gather and discuss data from the literature on the traditional risks of CV complications in PKU, a potential CV phenotype in this population and the various non-traditional risks and potential associated mechanisms. The reported prevalence of comorbidities suggests an increased risk of CV complications in adults with PKU, mostly in late-diagnosed patients. Studies about a specific CV phenotype associated with PKU are suggestive, although further studies are needed. The data on oxidative stress in this population are consistent and confirm an increased CV risk. Regarding other potential mechanisms, it is not possible to conclude whether adult PKU patients have low grade inflammation, dyslipidemia, kidney impairment or if they have hyperhomocysteinemia. It would be of interest to measure potential biomarker associated with CV complications, such as homocysteine, asymmetric dimethylarginine and kynurenines (quinolic acid).",114,1294,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176071/

Results regarding aggressive lipid-lowering therapies (LLT) are missing. We examined LEAD patients with Lp(a) measurement and the impact of intensive LLT on amputation and survival.
METHODS: Baseline characteristics of 263 LEAD patients with Lp(a) measurement treated in a tertiary hospital from 01/2017 until 01/2022 were recorded. Patients were categorized into three groups according to their Lp(a) values (< 30 mg/dL, 30-90 mg/dL and > 90 mg/dL). Lipid values and LLT were recorded at baseline and during follow-up (median 750 days). Peripheral endovascular revascularizations (EVR), amputations and death during follow-up were analysed.
RESULTS: Of 263 patients, 75% were male, mean age was 67 ± 10 years. Elevated Lp(a) values ≥ 30 mg/dL were found in 32%, 16% had values > 90 mg/dL. Baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was 89 ± 38 mg/dL, decreasing to 61 ± 30 mg/dL at follow-up, with no difference between Lp(a) groups (63 ± 32 mg/dL vs. 52 ± 23 mg/dL vs. 60 ± 25 mg/dL, p = 0.273). Statin dose was intensified more frequently in those with elevated Lp(a) (16% vs. 35% vs. 33%, p = 0.005), who also received significantly more often ezetimibe (50% vs. 58% vs. 73%, p = 0.028) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (2% vs. 3% vs. 8%, p = 0.043). No difference was seen regarding EVR (91% vs. 95% vs. 90%, p = 0.729), amputations (4% vs. 7% vs. 0%, p = 0.245) and death (8% vs. 5% vs. 3%, p = 0.436).
CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive LLT in high-risk LEAD patients with elevated Lp(a) levels enabled LDL-C target achievement in a majority by combination of established lipid-lowering agents.

Finally, for SaO₂, the pre-alignment deviation was 2.6%, reduced to 0.1% post-alignment, both within the CLIA threshold of ± 5%, with a Bland-Altman mean difference of 0.9614% (limits: 0.9594 to 0.9634%). The Passing-Bablok regression analysis confirmed strong agreement, with slopes close to 1.0100 and intercepts near zero for all parameters. These results validate the QPS as a reliable and non-inferior tool for real-time blood gas monitoring during cardiopulmonary bypass, adhering to CLIA standards and ensuring clinical accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the accuracy of the Quantum Perfusion System compared to the BGA standard, demonstrating the system's capability to provide accurate, continuous blood gas monitoring during CPB. However, further studies are necessary to strengthen and confirm these results across broader and more varied clinical scenarios, for these reason as recommended by the manufacturers, the quantum monitoring system should only be used as a trending device.",124,3049,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176027/
Cardiology,40175975,"""I can't endure it"" vs. ""I can handle it"" - experiencing work fatigue risk for nurses: a qualitative study.","Pi R, Liu Y, Yan R, OuYang Y, Li W, Hou Z, De Z, Liu F, He Z, Mei Y, Li S",2025,"BACKGROUND: Work fatigue has become a significant challenge for nursing staff, yet there is a paucity of qualitative research that explores their lived experiences in this context. This study aims to examine clinical nurses' experiences with work fatigue risk and to identify the hindering and facilitating factors contributing to this issue.
METHODS: In this study with descriptive phenomenological method, semi-structured interviews with 25 nurses conducted in the meeting room of a hospital from June to August 2024. Colaizzi's seven-step analysis method was used for data analysis.
RESULTS: Three main themes with twelve subthemes were identified. The primary themes included: (1) phases of work fatigue risk experience, (2) hindering factors of work fatigue risk management, and (3) facilitating factors of work fatigue risk management. Nurses faced a combination of facilitators and inhibitors in managing work fatigue. While some nurses demonstrated a positive attitude towards their work, others showed a strong intention to leave the profession.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings offer a nuanced understanding of the dynamic stages of nurses' work fatigue experience, highlighting both hindering and facilitating factors that influence the management of work fatigue risk. Nurses encounter multiple challenges in managing work fatigue effectively, underscoring the need for comprehensive strategies. These strategies should address structural barriers while fostering individual resilience, ultimately promoting a healthier and more sustainable work environment.",107,1563,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40175975/
Cardiology,40175938,Clinical efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan combined with cardiac rehabilitation in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction: a single-center randomized trial.,"Zhao YM, Luo JT, Pang KF, Feng Y, Tan JP, Liu M, Lin ZH",2025,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of sacubitril/valsartan (ARNI) combined with cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in patients with heart failure (HF) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: A total of 118 patients with HF after AMI were screened and randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group. The control group was given ARNI. The experimental group received CR treatment in addition to the control treatment. The primary endpoint was cardiorespiratory fitness as measured by the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). The secondary endpoints included cardiac remodeling detected by NT-ProBNP and cardiac ultrasound. All participants were assessed by CPET, NT-ProBNP, and cardiac ultrasound at baseline and after treatment.
RESULTS: After treatment, the changes in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), anaerobic threshold (AT), oxygen uptake peak (VO<sub>2</sub> peak), and metabolic equivalents (METs) in the experimental group were significantly greater than those in the control group (all P &lt; 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in BNP, Left atrial diameter (LA) or Left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVD) between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HF after AMI could benefit from combined ARNI and CR.

Cardiology,40175935,A case report on the implantation of a leadless pacemaker in a patient with eosinophilic fasciitis and third-degree atrioventricular block.,"Huang LJ, Chen JS, Zou Q, Song YZ, Yan Y, Wang ZF, Wang HJ, Chang P",2025,"Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by the involvement of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia. The treatment for EF usually involves long-term use of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants. Patients with EF are at risk of developing third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block during the course of the disease. The distinctive features of EF, the side effects of its treatment, and the inherent limitations of transvenous pacemakers (TVPs) present significant challenges in the management of patients with EF who also have third-degree AV block. We present the case of a 64-year-old Chinese male diagnosed with EF and concomitant third-degree AV block. Given the patient's skin tissue characteristics, the increased risk of infection associated with long-term immunosuppressive therapy, and the potential complications related to TVPs we chose to implant a leadless pacemaker(LP) in the apical region of the right ventricle. This case report underscores the importance of identifying potential cardiovascular complications in EF patients treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. It also highlights the clinical benefit of LP implantation in managing patients with EF and third-degree AV block, especially in terms of minimizing device-related complications and infection risks. This study offers a fresh perspective on the treatment of EF patients who have third-degree AV block and advocates for the use of LPs as a preferred option for cardiac pacing in this patient group. Further research is warranted to evaluate the indications and potential benefits of LPs in a wider range of patients.",139,1653,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40175935/
Cardiology,40175932,Masked uncontrolled hypertension in patients with end-stage kidney disease on in-center hemodialysis.,"Nguyen HH, Trinh NTT, Tran MH, Pham HT",2025,"BACKGROUND: Masked uncontrolled hypertension (MUCH) is associated with an increasing risk of morbidity and mortality. Current literature on MUCH lacks data on patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on hemodialysis (HD). We aimed to investigate the prevalence, ambulatory blood pressure (BP) characteristics, and risk factors of MUCH in this population in a low-middle-income Asian country.
METHODS: We conducted a simple random-sampling, cross-sectional study on patients with hypertension and ESKD on HD. The outcome was MUCH, which was confirmed if the participants, who were on 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring, had at least 1 of the following criteria: (1) daytime mean ambulatory BP ≥ 135 mmHg (systolic) and/or ≥ 85 mmHg (diastolic); (2) night-time mean ambulatory BP ≥ 120 mmHg (systolic) and/or ≥ 70 mmHg (diastolic); or (3) 24-hour mean ambulatory BP ≥ 130 mmHg (systolic) and/or ≥ 80 mmHg (diastolic). Data were presented using descriptive statistics. We used logistic regression to explore the risk factors for MUCH, and the results were reported with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI).
RESULTS: Among 104 participants included for analysis (median age 54.5, 48.1% being female), MUCH was reported on 85 of them (prevalence of 81.7%, 95% CI 73.2-88.0%.). Non-dipping status of BP were found in 98.1% of the participants, with non-dippers dominating the normotension group (prevalence of 57.9%, 95% CI 36.3-76.9%) and reverse dippers dominating the MUCH group (prevalence of 65.9%, 95% CI 55.3-75.1%). We also identified some factors that were associated with a higher risk of MUCH, i.e., being current smoker (adjusted OR = 3.49, 95% CI 1.07 to 11.40), undergoing HD for > 48 months (adjusted OR = 5.69, 95% CI 1.48 to 21.81), taking > 3 antihypertensive medications (adjusted OR = 3.64, 95% CI 1.11 to 11.92), and requiring α2-adrenergic receptor agonists for BP control (adjusted OR = 6.31, 95% CI 1.12 to 35.62).
CONCLUSION: The prevalences of MUCH and non-dipping of BP (non-dipper and reverse dipper) were very high in patients with ESKD who were undergoing HD for a median duration of 6 years without ambulatory BP monitoring. To avoid extra cost and inconvenience, risk factors should be initially screened for MUCH before monitoring out-of-office BP for a confirmed diagnosis.",101,2321,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40175932/
Neurology,40176165,Immunoadsorption study Mainz in adults with post-COVID syndrome (IAMPOCO)-a single-blinded sham-controlled crossover trial to evaluate the effect of immunoadsorption on post-COVID syndrome.,"Stortz M, Klimpke P, Kommer A, Gründer P, Steenken L, Dresel C, Kraus D, Schmidtmann I, Weinmann A, Weinmann-Menke J",2025,"BACKGROUND: Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) affects up to 43% of all SARS-CoV-2-infected persons and describes ongoing symptoms months after the acute infection. Despite the large number of affected people, there is still very little evidence about therapeutic options. Some studies suggest at least partially a role of autoantibody-mediated autoimmunity. Immunoadsorption is an extracorporeal therapy to remove circulating antibodies which is used successfully in several autoimmune diseases. We conceived the IAMPOCO trial to evaluate the therapeutic effect of immunoadsorption in patients with PCS.
METHODS: IAMPOCO is a single-center randomized sham-controlled trial with a crossover design which will enroll 40 participants with PCS and a symptom severity of at least 2 on post-COVID functional scale. All participants will undergo 5 immunoadsorption treatments and after a washout period of 8 weeks 5 sham treatments or vice versa. Which modality is conducted first will be randomized. Patients but not providers of therapy are blinded for which modality is conducted. Primary outcome is the efficacy of IA to the severity of PCS measured by the change of several symptom scores and hand grip strength. Secondary outcomes are the frequency of adverse events and the prevalence of relevant autoantibodies in participants with PCS as well as the concentration of autoantibodies before and after therapy and sham treatment.
DISCUSSION: The trial addresses the lack of evidence for treatment options in PCS. By using a crossover design and including a sham treatment arm, the study aims to compare the effects of immunoadsorption and sham therapy within the same patients. The trial also benefits from recruiting participants from a cohort study on PCS prevalence, ensuring a thorough evaluation of symptoms. Objective assessments of symptoms are challenging due to their subjective nature, but various scoring systems and tests are being utilized. Despite the lack of data from RCTs, the results of this study have the potential to significantly improve PCS therapy and support evidence-based treatment decisions.

Neurology,40176136,CSF outflow from the human spinal canal: preliminary results from an anatomical specimen-based model.,"Rzepliński R, Proulx ST, Tarka S, Stępień T, Ciszek B",2025,"BACKGROUND: Recent discoveries focused on the role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in metabolite clearance have initiated intense research on CSF circulation and outflow pathways. These studies have focused on the cranial subarachnoid space, whereas spinal outflow has been relatively less investigated. Moreover, most studies have been performed on rodent models, which allows thorough anatomical investigation, whereas evidence from humans has been generated primarily from in vivo neuroimaging techniques. In this paper, we introduce an anatomical specimen-based preparation for studying spinal CSF outflow in humans and present preliminary results from our initial studies.
METHODS: Unfixed anatomical specimens of the thoracolumbar spinal dural sac along with the spinal nerves were obtained from cadavers. Experiments involving low-pressure infusion of contrast medium (barium sulfate) into the spinal subarachnoid space with video recording of contrast spread were performed. After fixation, contrast agent distribution of the samples was assessed via histological and radiological analyses including 3D X-ray microscopy.
RESULTS: Five human anatomical specimens of the dural sac were assessed. Filling of spaces extending to the spinal dura (arachnoid granulations, cuffs around the proximal spinal nerves) and unrestricted outflow from postganglionic spinal nerve cross-sections were both observed. Histological and radiological results confirmed the presence of contrast around the spinal nerve fascicles under the perineurium, in the arachnoid granulations and within the lumens of vessels within the dura or in the surrounding epidural adipose tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: The described model makes it possible to examine CSF outflow routes from the human spinal subarachnoid space. The methodology is reproducible, feasible, and does not require specialized equipment. Preliminary results have revealed two potential CSF outflow pathways that have been previously observed in animal models: along the spinal nerves and to the epidural tissue and vessels.",101,2056,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176136/
Neurology,40176124,Inducing mononuclear cells of patients with CADASIL to construct a CSVD disease model.,"Wang Z, Yin J, Chao W, Zhang X",2025,"OBJECTIVE: To produce pluripotent stem cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a patient with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and culture and differentiate them into vascular organoids, producing a disease model for cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD).
METHODS: (1) PMBCs from patients clinically diagnosed with CADASIL (NOTCH3 p.R141C) were induced to differentiate into pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); the quality and differentiation ability of the iPSCs were determined. (2) CADASIL-derived iPSCs and control iPSCs were cultured and differentiated into vascular organoids. The differences in the morphological structure of the two differentiated groups of vascular organoids were observed, and both were identified.
RESULTS: (1) No mycoplasma infections were detected in the iPSCs prepared from the PBMCs of patients with CADASIL. The short tandem repeat (STR) identification verified that the iPSCs originated from the patient, and the karyotype was normal. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence detection revealed that the iPSCs expressed SSEA4, OCT4, and NANOG stem proteins. Tri-germ differentiation testing confirmed that the iPSCs expressed the endoderm markers SOX17 and FOXA2, the mesoderm markers Brachyury and α-SMA, and the ectoderm markers Pax6 and β-III Tubulin. (2) CADASIL-derived iPSCs and control iPSCs were induced to differentiate and produce endothelial networks and vascular networks, ultimately forming vascular organoids. Compared with control vascular organoids, CADASIL vascular organoids exhibited lower growth density, earlier blood vessel sprouting, longer and thinner vascular filaments, and smaller final vascular organoids. The vascular organoids from the two sources expressed the endothelial cell marker CD31, the vascular smooth muscle marker α-SMA, and the pericyte marker PDGFR-β.
CONCLUSION: Reprogramming technology can be used to induce PBMCs to become iPSCs, and a CSVD disease model can be successfully constructed by culturing and differentiating the iPSCs into CADASIL vascular organoids. The NOTCH3 p.R141C mutation suppresses the vascular differentiation process in CADASIL.",86,2209,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176124/
Neurology,40176122,Effects of 52 weeks of precuneus rTMS in Alzheimer's disease patients: a randomized trial.,"Koch G, Casula EP, Bonnì S, Borghi I, Assogna M, Di Lorenzo F, Esposito R, Maiella M, D'Acunto A, Ferraresi M, Mencarelli L, Pezzopane V, Motta C, Santarnecchi E, Bozzali M, Martorana A",2025,"BACKGROUND: Personalized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the precuneus (PC) is emerging as a new non-invasive therapeutic approach in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we sought to investigate the effects of 52 weeks of rTMS applied over the PC on cognitive functions in patients with mild-to-moderate dementia due to AD.
METHODS: Forty-eight patients with mild-to-moderate dementia due to AD were enrolled for the study. Of those 31 patients were extended to 52 weeks after being included in a 24-week trial (NCT03778151) with the same experimental design. The trial included a 52-week treatment with a 2-week intensive course where rTMS (or sham) was applied over the PC daily (5 times per week, Monday to Friday), followed by a 50-week maintenance phase in which the same stimulation was applied once weekly. Personalization of rTMS treatment was established using neuronavigated TMS in combination with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 52 of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Secondary outcomes included score changes in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale- Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)<sub>11</sub>, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Changes in cortical activity and connectivity were monitored by TMS-EEG.
RESULTS: Among 48 patients randomized (mean age 72.8 years; 56% women), 32 (68%) completed the study. Repetitive TMS of the PC (PC-rTMS) had a significant effect on the primary outcome measure. The estimated mean change in CDR-SB after 52 week was 1.36 for PC-rTMS (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.68, 2.04]) and 2.45 for sham-rTMS group (95%CI [1.85, 3.05]). There were also significant effects for the secondary outcomes ADAS-Cog<sub>11</sub>, ADCS-ADL and NPI scores. Stronger DMN connectivity at baseline was associated with favorable response to rTMS treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Fifty-two weeks of PC-rTMS may slow down the impairment of cognitive functions, activities of daily living and behavioral disturbances in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Further multicenter studies are needed to confirm the clinical potential of DMN personalized rTMS.

Neurology,40176112,Tofacitinib treatment for psoriatic skin lesions associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome 7/Singleton-Merten syndrome 1.,"Beerepoot S, Grinwis L, Vanderver AL, van der Knaap MS, Kuijpers TW",2025,"The purpose of this letter to the editor is to illustrate the effect of tofacitinib on psoriatic skin lesions in a patient with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) type 7/Singleton-Merten syndrome 1. AGS is characterized by an encephalopathy of variable severity and systemic autoinflammatory manifestations due to continuous type I interferon (IFN) induction. While traditional JAK 1/2 inhibitors like baricitinib and ruxolitinib have proven effectiveness for systemic inflammatory symptoms, they face reimbursement issues in some countries. Tofacitinib, a JAK 1/3 inhibitor, significantly improved psoriatic skin lesions in our patient without the need for additional immunosuppressive therapy. Within one month of starting tofacitinib, psoriatic rashes and ulcerative skin lesions markedly improved, in the absence of a reduction in the IFN-stimulated gene signature or CD169 expression on monocytes. The clinical benefits persisted until the treatment was discontinued, after which symptoms recurred. Resuming tofacitinib treatment again led to improvement. No adverse effects were observed. This case highlights the potential of tofacitinib as a clinically effective treatment for psoriatic skin lesions in AGS and offers a viable alternative for JAK 1/2 inhibitors for this target symptom. Further studies are needed to confirm the long-term safety of JAK 1/3 inhibitors in AGS as well as their possible efficacy and dosing to address other systemic symptoms or neurologic manifestations.",122,1491,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176112/
Neurology,40176085,Enlarged choroid plexus is linked with poorer physical function in rural older adults: a population-based study.,"Xie Q, Chen Z, Wang J, Zhang H, Wang Y, Wang X, Li C, Wang Y, Cong L, Ferreira D, Welmer AK, Song L, Du Y, Qiu C",2025,"BACKGROUND: The choroid plexus (ChP) plays an important role in producing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and physical dysfunction has been associated with alterations in CSF circulation. However, no population-based studies have thus far examined the association of ChP with physical function in older people.
METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study included 1217 participants (age ≥ 60 years; 57.35% women) in the MRI substudy of the Multimodal Interventions to delay Dementia and disability in rural China. ChP volume was automatically segmented using three-dimensional T1-weighted sequences. Physical function was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Data were analyzed using general linear regression and mediation models.
RESULTS: Controlling for demographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, stroke, disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus (DESH), and total intracranial volume, per 1-ml increase in ChP volume was associated with β-coefficient of -0.24 (95% confidence interval: -0.37 to -0.11) for SPPB summary score, with the association being stronger in females (-0.40; -0.60 to -0.20) than in males (-0.17; -0.33 to -0.01) (p for ChP volume×sex interaction = 0.028). The associations were similar across three domains of balance, chair stand, and walking speed. In addition, enlarged ChP volume was associated with increased ventricular volume and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume. Mediation analysis suggested that lateral ventricular volume and periventricular WMH volume significantly mediated the association of ChP volume with the SPPB summary score, with the proportion of mediation being 54.22% and 14.48%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Larger ChP volume is associated with poorer physical function in older adults, especially in women. The association is largely mediated by lateral ventricular and periventricular WMH volumes.",112,1917,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176085/
Neurology,40175988,"Priorities and expectations of researchers, funders, patients and the public regarding equity in medical research and funding: results from the PERSPECT qualitative study.","Ramkumar R, Betzner WR, Cristall N, Drozdowska BA, Fladt J, Jaroenngarmsamer T, McDonough R, Goyal M, Ganesh A",2025,"BACKGROUND: Considerations of equity in funding and conduct of medical research are receiving greater attention. However, perspectives of diverse stakeholder groups on this topic are poorly characterized. Our study aimed to further understand broad stakeholder perspectives and priorities regarding inequities in medical research and funding, including implications for international collaborations with low-and middle-income countries (LMICs).
METHODS: Participants were recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. We employed a qualitative descriptive methodology embedded in an interpretive grounded theory framework. This approach involved in-depth, semi-structured interviews with researchers, funders, patients, and members of the public. Participants were asked to discuss their perspectives on the current state of equity in medical research and funding. Collected data were analyzed using constant comparison, open-coding, and theme identification to generate a substantive theory.
RESULTS: We conducted 41 interviews involving 11 researchers, 10 funders, 10 patients, and 10 members of the public. Participants perceived several inequities within research participation, funding opportunities, topic prioritization, and lack of international collaborations inclusive of LMICs. Potential strategies to address these inequities were also identified. Through participants' perspectives, we developed a central theory that addressing inequities in medical research and funding can promote collaborative spaces and produce greater research impact for society, regardless of demographics, socioeconomic status, and geographical residence. While we gained diverse perspectives from four distinct stakeholder groups, our primary limitation was that participants in our study were predominantly from Canada and the United States.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants perceived various inequities in the funding and conduct of medical research. Our findings were primarily captured from participants living in Canada and the United States. However, we were able to gain insights of challenges and potential solutions through their diverse perspectives, and we are optimistic that sustaining efforts to mitigate medical research and funding inequities will help accelerate and broaden the societal impact of medical research within and across countries, including in LMICs.",171,2368,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40175988/

Up to 50% of PG cases - a rare, non-infectious inflammatory skin disease characterized by painful necrotic ulcers -are associated with underlying systemic diseases like Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), moreover with monoclonal antibody therapy.
CASE PRESENTATION: We described a 38-year-old female patient with multiple sclerosis (MS) who was treated for three years with Natalizumab. Myalgia, fever, and erythematous plaques accompanied by painful lesions in both upper extremities manifested with the fifteenth dosage of NTZ. After comprehensive testing and a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan, we excluded other systemic diseases and a recurrence of multiple sclerosis, respectively. After consulting a dermatologist, a skin biopsy was performed, and pathology report confirmed PG. Eventually, the lesions began to heal after stopping NTZ injection without receiving any dermatological care.
CONCLUSION: Based on PG incidence, it was associated with some medications like Rituximab and Ocrelizumab, on the other hand, after discontinuation of NTZ the lesions started to heal even without dermatological treatment. In our situation, it is conceivable that NTZ injection, and PG incidence are connected.",101,1326,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40175973/
Neurology,40175934,The effect of patient-centered empowerment program through telenursing on self-management in people with multiple sclerosis: a double-blinded randomized clinical trial.,"Bayat F, Negarandeh R, Pashaeypoor S",2025,"BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that presents individuals with various caregiving challenges, making their empowerment based on their real needs essential. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of a patient-centered empowerment program through telenursing on the self-management of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).
METHODS: The present study was a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial conducted on 90 PwMS attending MS Society using a convenience sampling method with random block allocation. The inclusion criteria were a definite diagnosis of MS for at least 6 months, age range of 18 to 60 years, ability to use a telephone and smartphone, no other physical or mental illnesses, and no cognitive or psychological disorders based on self-report and patient records. Additionally, the participants who were not able to continue the intervention due to reasons such as fatigue, unwillingness, or hospitalization could not follow the study. The tools used included a demographic questionnaire and the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Management Scale (Healthcare Provider Relationship and Communication, Treatment Adherence/Barriers, Social/Family Support, MS Knowledge and Information, and Health Maintenance Behavior). The research intervention involved providing an empowerment program through 5 telenursing sessions over 4 weeks, with the number of sessions varying based on each person's needs. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 26.
RESULTS: In this study, data from 90 individuals with MS were analyzed. Findings indicated that the majority of the study participants were female (62.2%) and married (55.6%). The results indicated no significant differences in the mean scores of self-management and its relevant subscales, between the two groups before the intervention (P > 0.05). However, after the intervention, the mean scores showed a significant difference in the intervention group compared to the control group in terms of self-management index (91.62 ± 11.14 vs. 88.51 ± 11.27), and subscales of MS Knowledge and Information (15.82 ± 1.28 vs. 14.89 ± 2.4) and Health Maintenance Behavior (15.27 ± 2.87 vs. 14.84 ± 3.37) (P < 0.05). The calculated effect size indicates a medium effect (Cohen's d = 0.56).
CONCLUSION: Empowering PwMS, focusing on their unique needs and delivering it through telenursing, can be an effective method in enhancing their self-management capabilities. Therefore, it is recommended that healthcare providers in chronic diseases prioritize patient empowerment based on individual needs.

Investigating the CNS-compartmentalized inflammation associated with progressive MS could uncover new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interleukin-6 (IL-6) can be markedly elevated in neuroinflammatory conditions, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease. This study investigated the association between CSF IL-6 levels, progressive disease, and disease severity in MS.
METHODS: Advanced technologies, including single-molecule arrays and microfluidics, were used to analyse CSF samples from individuals with MS at the time of diagnosis for IL-6. IL-6 levels were then correlated with clinical course, disease severity, and other known biomarkers associated with inflammation and disease severity.
RESULTS: Elevated IL-6 levels in the CSF were found in individuals with progressive MS, and CSF IL-6 showed positive correlations with the Expanded Disability Status Scale, the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score, and CSF glial fibrillary acidic protein levels.
CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 in CSF indicates ongoing CNS inflammation and may contribute to the compartmentalized inflammation associated with disease progression and overall disease severity.",117,1332,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40175894/

DISCUSSION: The trial addresses the lack of evidence for treatment options in PCS. By using a crossover design and including a sham treatment arm, the study aims to compare the effects of immunoadsorption and sham therapy within the same patients. The trial also benefits from recruiting participants from a cohort study on PCS prevalence, ensuring a thorough evaluation of symptoms. Objective assessments of symptoms are challenging due to their subjective nature, but various scoring systems and tests are being utilized. Despite the lack of data from RCTs, the results of this study have the potential to significantly improve PCS therapy and support evidence-based treatment decisions.

COVID-19,40176134,Health in Kerala: exploring achievements and remaining challenges of health systems reform using an equity lens.,"D HS, Thekkumakara Surendran A, Gaitonde R, Nambiar D",2025,"BACKGROUND: The southern Indian state of Kerala is often regarded as a global model for its impressive health outcomes at a low cost. While the state consistently invests in healthcare and showcases remarkable health indicators, disparities persist, particularly among underserved populations who experience poorer health outcomes. This special issue focuses on research work that examines health equity in the region.
METHODS: Following an open call for the collection featuring research studies focusing on health equity in Kerala in 2022, we received 29 submissions; four editors handled the submissions, and after peer review, nine articles were finally published as part of the special issue.
RESULTS: The final collection has nine articles which include studies describing health system efforts and user experiences about the control of tuberculosis, two evaluations of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) reforms in the state, a commentary on challenges faced by transgender persons in accessing gender-affirming medical care, two qualitative studies that span the UHC reform process and policies through the lens of a marginalized section of society, a case study on rabies death and a cross-sectional analysis characterizing the impact of COVID 19 pandemic in the mental health of school children.
CONCLUSION: The special issue contributes to the growing body of literature around health equity in Kerala and India and documents key challenges that plague the state health system like persisting access issues to seek necessary care, lack of acknowledgment of important social determinants in policies, absence of targeted interventions for underserved communities, and shortcomings in engaging with the private sector - that continue to plague the journey of moving towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The findings suggest that custom made policies are required to address the specific health needs of underserved population rather than a doing ""more of same"" approach.",112,1980,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176134/
COVID-19,40176049,Heme-induced lung injury in human precision cut lung slices: a new model for acute lung injury.,"Kewalramani N, Machahua C, Marti TM, Zandbergen C, Chortarea S, Beretta-Piccoli J, von Garnier C, Dorn P, Fytianos K, Funke-Chambour M",2025,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causes high mortality and has no specific pharmacological treatment. Scarcity of drugs against ARDS is in part due to the lack of models for ARDS. As raised serum heme levels are associated with higher mortality in patients with ARDS, we hypothesised that circulating heme contributes to ARDS pathology and can induce lung injury resembling human disease. We aimed to develop a new model for acute lung injury and ARDS research with heme-induced injury in human precision cut lung slices (PCLS).
METHODS: We analysed heme and its degrading enzymes along with inflammatory cytokines in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and ARDS compared to healthy adult subjects. In PCLS, we studied effects of heme on cell survival, membrane integrity, the transcriptome by gene expression and the proteome by protein expression analysis or ELISA. We also tested synergistical effects with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on cell survival in addition to heme to simulate bacterial infection.
RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS had increased serum levels of heme and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) compared to controls. In PCLS, heme induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner, stimulated pro-inflammatory and injury signals and triggered changes to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Comparative analyses of the lung transcriptomic and proteomic signatures revealed 27 common markers (log2 fold change greater than 1, at adjusted (adj) p-value < 0.05 significant), most of which were inflammatory. Similar inflammatory cytokines were raised in blood from patients with COVID-19 and ARDS compared to controls. LPS did not increase cytotoxicity in addition to heme.
CONCLUSION: Heme induced inflammatory cytokine release and cell death in human PCLS, resembling the patterns observed in blood samples from patients with COVID-19 and ARDS. Thus, heme-stimulated PCLS represent a novel ex vivo model for mechanistic studies for acute lung injury and ARDS.",95,1999,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40176049/
COVID-19,40176038,Burden of non-COVID-19 lower respiratory infections in China (1990-2021): a global burden of disease study analysis.,"Li M, Song Z, Wan W, Zhou H",2025,"BACKGROUND: The assessment of lower respiratory infection (LRI) mortality, incidence, and responsible pathogens in China provides a scientific basis for the prevention and management of LRI, especially for evaluating the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We provide a national estimate of the non-COVID-19 LRI burden and trends on people from 1990 to 2021 based on Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2021.
METHODS: We estimated China's mortality, incidence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), risk factors and aetiology attribution for LRI without including COVID-19 by using the estimated data of GBD study 2021. Mortality, incidence, DALYs, risk factors and aetiology were stratified by sex and age. Trends were evaluated using estimated annual percentage change.
RESULTS: In 2021, it is estimated that there were 206930.22 deaths (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 171260.88-251990.47), with all-age mortality rate of 14.54 deaths (95% UI: 12.04-17.71) per 100,000 population. Compared to 2019, the all-age mortality rate had a 3.60% increase. Analyzing risk factors from 1990 to 2021, we found that the percentage of DALYs attributed to tobacco increased from 7.44% (95% UI: 1.26-15.72%) to 22.14% (95% UI: 3.28-38.41%), and that attributable to ambient particulate matter pollution increased from 19.84% (95% UI: 8.79-30.20%) to 32.72% (95% UI: 22.78-41.77%). The leading cause of mortality from LRIs remains Streptococcus pneumoniae from 1990 to 2021. However, the proportions of viral infections decreased. Compared to 2019, the proportion of deaths in 2021 caused by Influenza decreased from 13.03 to 2.70%, and the proportion of deaths due to RSV decreased from 2.21 to 0.41%.
CONCLUSIONS: In China, substantial progress has been made in reducing LRI mortality, yet LRIs have remained a threat in China from 1990 to 2021. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the mortality attributable to Influenza and RSV declined. Effective vaccines and treatments targeted at the main pathogens of LRI are important.

COVID-19,40175997,The effect of prosocial modelling on medical students' professional identity in China: a PSM-DID analysis.,"Wang D, Wang D, Shi Z, Wu H",2025,"BACKGROUND: Although role models significantly impact medical students' professional identity, empirical evidence is relatively scarce, and our understanding of the mechanisms behind this influence is limited. Through the lens of prosocial modelling, we explored the effects of role models on medical students' professional identity and attempted to elucidate the underlying reasons.
METHODS: By leveraging the varying number of personnel dispatched by various provinces across China to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, we established indicators for different intensities of prosocial modelling. Using data from the two years before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a quasi-experimental study. Employing the propensity score matching difference-in-differences method, we explored the effects of prosocial modelling on medical students' professional identity.
RESULTS: Prosocial modelling significantly enhanced medical students' professional identity (β = 0.087, p < 0.01), and the effect remained significant even after controlling for economic factors and the pandemic's severity (β = 0.067, p < 0.001). Notably, prosocial modelling more significantly impacted the professional identity of female students, those under economic pressure, those uncertain about becoming doctors during high school, and those ranked in the bottom 50% academically.
CONCLUSIONS: Prosocial modeling enhances medical students' professional identity, especially among females, economically disadvantaged students, those initially hesitant about a medical career, and lower-performing students. This highlights the need for role models in medical education to prioritize support for these disadvantaged groups to foster professional identities.",106,1732,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40175997/
COVID-19,40175987,A pilot intervention to reduce burnout and enhance resilience through transcendental meditation among Georgetown University medical students.,"Jammes C, Heiman I, Amri H",2025,"BACKGROUND: Rates of burnout, depression, and anxiety among healthcare workers are at historically high levels and have remained high in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. As aspiring physicians, medical students are the future of the healthcare profession. The practice of Transcendental Meditation (TM) has been shown to reduce burnout and stress in diverse populations, including healthcare professionals. To date, no data have been published on the benefits of TM for medical students. Our objective was to assess the efficacy of TM practice in reducing burnout and increasing resilience among medical students at Georgetown University School of Medicine (GUSoM) over three months between October 2022 and May 2023.
METHODS: Forty-two GUSoM medical students qualified for and enrolled in the study. Thirty-nine students completed three months of TM training and practice, with the recommended regimen of meditating for 20 min twice a day. The students were assessed at baseline, one month, and three months using measures of burnout, depression, anxiety, insomnia, well-being, and resilience, of which burnout (emotional exhaustion) and resilience were the primary outcomes. Two-tailed paired-sample t-tests were used to determine the significance of changes in outcome measures over time.
RESULTS: In the three-month post-test, significant changes were found for both primary outcomes, emotional exhaustion (p = 0.001, Cohen's d effect size = -0.61) and resilience (p = 0.002, d = 0.53), as well as for anxiety (p < 0.001, d = -0.71), insomnia (p = 0.002, d = -0.53), depersonalization (p = 0.017, d = -0.40), depression (p = 0.006, d = -0.47), and mental wellbeing (p = 0.031, d = 0.36). TM practice compliance was high at 85%. Additionally, there were significant relationships between frequency of TM home practice and improvements in emotional exhaustion (p = 0.005), anxiety (p = 0.008), and insomnia (p < 0.001), and a marginally significant relationship with depression (p = 0.088).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that TM practice is an accessible, achievable, and effective intervention to decrease burnout and increase resilience for medical students. This study paves the way for future initiatives to evaluate a broad range of benefits of TM for medical students.",141,2289,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40175987/
COVID-19,40175957,Factors influencing vaccine hesitancy toward non-covid vaccines in South Asia: a systematic review.,"Stuetzle SCW, Willis M, Barnowska EJ, Bonkass AK, Fastenau A",2025,"Declared as one of the ten most pressing threats to global health in 2019, the complexity around vaccine acceptance and hesitancy has once again gained great momentum following the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of vaccine acceptance may endanger the mission of improving vaccine uptake globally to tackle pandemics, reduce morbidity and mortality of preventable diseases and to prevent antibiotic resistance worldwide. Countries of the global south, including South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries are especially affected by the dangers of low vaccination uptake and continue to show decreases in coverage in recent years. This paper examines factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy in south Asia and the extent to which they are context and disease specific, guided by a modified version of the WHO SAGE 5 C model by Razai et al. Three databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles by using a comprehensive search strategy. Results from 44 quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method studies were included in the systematic review and appraised for quality, thematically analyzed and mapped onto the 5 C model. findings from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Afghanistan showed vaccine hesitancy to be context and vaccine-specific within different settings of the countries. The main factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy can be identified as narrow confidence in vaccines, miscommunication, and lack of knowledge embedded into overarching constraints and contexts. To tackle vaccine hesitancy in SAARC countries, interventions need to be co-created by communities and mutual trust needs to be ensured, for instance through increased equity in knowledge distribution.",99,1706,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40175957/
COVID-19,40175915,Lingering symptoms in non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 - a prospective survey study of symptom expression and effects on mental health in Germany.,"Rohde J, Bundschuh R, Kaußner Y, Simmenroth A",2025,"BACKGROUND: The infection rates with SARS-CoV 2 virus, known since 2019, are currently significantly weakened in their dynamics. Nevertheless, COVID 19 is still a common disease, which in most cases is overcome quite well and can be treated by the general practitioner. Despite an initially uncomplicated disease progression, the long-term consequences can be considerable. Symptoms persisting over a period of more than 12 weeks after infection are summarized as Post-COVID (PC) syndrome. The aim of this study is to document the symptom expression in PC patients in the outpatient setting, with a major focus on limitations in daily life and consequences for mental health.
METHODS: This survey is part of a prospective European collaborative study with the German cohort having been slightly extended and evaluated separately. Data collection was performed by telephone interviews of adult SARS CoV 2 positive patients using standardized questionnaires (38 open and 6 closed questions). After an inclusion interview, follow-up interviews were conducted every 4 weeks over a period of 6 months. Participants were recruited in collaboration with the local health department (Wuerzburg, Germany).
RESULTS: Sixty participants were recruited in April and May 2021. After 12 weeks (PC cutoff), 48.3% still reported symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue/tiredness (33.3%), reduced concentration (26.7%), and shortness of breath (23.3%). One-quarter of respondents reported impaired functioning, with the most common daily limitations being sports (28.3%), work (25.0%), and social life (15.0%). At 6 months, 21.6% of respondents experienced anxiety and 11.6% reported depressive symptoms. Overall, 40.0% of respondents were concerned that their health would deteriorate again or not fully normalize because of COVID-19. Over two-thirds (70.0%) visited a physician during the course of the study because of COVID-19, 73.8% of whom visited their general practitioner.
CONCLUSION: PC in outpatient care appears to be a complex and multifaceted condition that not only presents with physical symptoms, but also has a significant impact on mental health and daily life. Although the complexity of the condition is not yet fully understood, our findings suggest that it presents long-term challenges, particularly in outpatient care. Further research, particularly in larger and more diverse cohorts, is needed to confirm these observations. Routine screening for psychosocial comorbidities could be a valuable approach to identify supportive interventions that may help to reduce the risk of chronification and/or somatization.",153,2671,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40175915/
COVID-19,40175899,Trends in CT pulmonary angiography utilization and recurrent imaging in sickle cell disease: a longitudinal study.,"Hassan A, Alomani N, Kalalah M, Mujbel N, Khamdan Z, Alobaydun M, AlAlmai M, Alazmi Z, Musihel A, Qabha H, Adnan J",2025,"BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common inherited hemoglobinopathy associated with vaso-occlusive events that can mimic pulmonary embolism (PE), leading to the frequent use of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). However, trends in CTPA utilization over time remain unclear. This study aims to evaluate temporal trends and recurrent imaging patterns.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain, including SCD patients who underwent CTPA for suspected PE between April 15, 2013, and April 15, 2024. Descriptive statistics were used to report the frequency of recurrent scans, whereas linear regression analysis was employed to assess trends in CTPA utilization over the study period.
RESULTS: The study included 1,084 patients (median age: 35 years, 55.7% male) with SCD who underwent a total of 1,934 CTPA scans. CTPA utilization remained stable from 2014 to 2020, averaging 10.0-13.6 scans per month. However, a significant surge was observed post-2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, peaking in 2023, with an average of 31.3 scans per month, indicating a 2.9-fold increase (p = 0.03). During the study period, 415 patients (38.3%) underwent recurrent CTPA scans, with one-third (32.5%, n = 276) of these scans occurring within a 6-month interval. Although the PE positivity rate was lower in recurrent scans than in initial scans, the difference was not statistically significant (8.8% vs. 10.5%; p = 0.22).
CONCLUSIONS: CTPA utilization among SCD patients remained stable for several years but increased significantly after 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. A substantial proportion of scans were recurrent, with many occurring within a short interval. Moving forward, efforts should focus on mitigating radiation exposure through low-dose protocols and investigating potential factors contributing to the recent increase in scan utilization.",114,1934,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40175899/
COVID-19,40175846,Discovery and optimization of AAK1 inhibitors based on 1H-indazole scaffold for the potential treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Hui Z, Deng H, Xu Y, Gao Y, Zhai C, Mao ND, Che H, Li Z, Zhang Y, Zhang H, Xie T, Ye XY",2025,"The process of various virus entry into host cells, including SARS-CoV-2, is mediated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). AP-2 plays a crucial role in this process by recognizing membrane receptors and binding with clathrin, facilitating the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles and promoting CME. AAK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of AP2M1 subunit at Thr156. Therefore, suppressing AAK1 activity can hinder virus invasion by blocking CME. indicating that AAK1 could be a potential target for developing novel antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we present a series of novel AAK1 inhibitors based on previously reported AAK1 inhibitors. Drug design was carried out by fusing the 1H-indazole scaffold of SGC-AAK1-1 with pharmacophore groups of compound 6, and further optimized with the assistance of molecular docking. Among the 42 compounds novelly synthesized, compounds 9i, 9s, 11f and 11l exhibited comparable antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to reference compound 6 at the concentration of 3 μM. Particularly, 11f showed almost no cytotoxicity at all tested concentrations. Additionally, 11f exhibited favorable predictive pharmacokinetic properties. These findings support the potential of 11f as a lead compound for developing antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as potentially other viruses which are dependent on the CME process to enter host cells. In summary, we have expanded the structural types of AAK1 inhibitors and successfully obtained effective AAK1 inhibitors with antiviral capabilities.",128,1573,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40175846/
